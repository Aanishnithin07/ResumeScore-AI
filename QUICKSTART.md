## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues:

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**spaCy model not found:**
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Kill processes on ports 3000 and 8000
# macOS/Linux:
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**CORS errors:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 8000
- Check that frontend `.env.local` has correct API URL
